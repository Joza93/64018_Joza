# Objective: Maximize profit (Z) by determining the production quantities of three product sizes at three plant locations.

# Objective function: Z = 420(L1 + L2 + L3) + 360(M1 + M2 + M3) + 300(S1 + S2 + S3)

# Constraints:
# 1. Production capacity constraints
# 2. In-process storage space constraints
# 3. Sales forecasts constraints

# Load the necessary R library for LP problem solving
